Data Cleaning

The "Dec-18" age column was recoded, the like/dislike_hw columns were scaled and recoded as 1-8, and columns not relevant to our analysis were removed.

Sample Demographics

Descriptive statistics were used to glean demographic information about the sample. The sample size of the dataset used is n = 1175, which is a fairly robust number for a psychology study. Gender distribution was nearly balanced, with males representing 55.2% of the total sample, 44.1% female, and 0.7% preferring not to answer. The age of the sample ranged from under 18 to 60+, with the majority of the sample between the ages of 19-25 (n = 345), followed by 26-32 (n = 241). The occupational distribution showed the majority of the sample being working professionals, (n = 479), followed by students in college (n = 358; an unsurprising finding considering the majority of psychology studies are conducted at universities/colleges).
