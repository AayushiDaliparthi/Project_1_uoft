Interpretation 

The pie chart illustrates people's opinion about their home environment during COVD 19 pandemic. According to the chart around 50% of the population indicated that they do not like (strongly dislike and dislike) the home environment. Approximately 25% expressed they like(stronly like and like) their home environment, remainder percentage had a neutral opinion about their home environment. The COVID 19 pandemic necessitated widespread lockdown and social distancing measures, leading many people spend more time at home than usual. Extended time of confinement at home might have led them feel dissatisfaction with the home enviroment and also  limited socialisation, remote working  and concerns about health and safety could have contributed negative perception of the home environment during pandemic.

The first box plot illustrates there is correlation between people's preferences for their home environment and their willingness to work from home. If people strongly dislike their home environment, they might find it challanging to be comfortable working from home, leading to a preference for working in a different environment, like an office or other setting. Conversely if people enjoy their home environment, they may prefer working from home, as it offers them the comfort and convenience they desire.This observation highlights the impotance of considering individuals' preference and comfort levels when implementing remote work policies or making decisions about workplace environments. Understanding and accomadating these preferences can contribute to higher efficiency and overall well being among employees.
