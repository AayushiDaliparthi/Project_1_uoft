Note: The data set was cleaned in a way that made it easier to interpret:
- Age Range: December 18th was recorded as 12-8
- time_bp, time_dp, travel_time are coded in hours
- easeof_online, home_env are rated in a 5 point scale (1 = bad, 5 = good)
- prodinc, sleepball, newskill, famconnect, relaxed, selftime, are rated in a 5 point scale (-1 to +1)
- dropped last column: time_bp.1 

Interpretation of Data

During the pandemic, professionals of all kinds had to start working from home to keep safe. Some workers in certain environments thrive better in an on-site position while others do better working from their own home. We can see that the line of work that had the most difference of opinion are architecture workers. They heavily dislike working from home. This might be because their work requires more in-person site visits and access to certain tools and resources that might not be available at home. The line of work with the least difference in opinion are "Other", but since we can't interpret what that means, next up are teachers. Teachers are nearly equal in their dislike and like of work from home. This might be due to different teaching styles, the content itself of the course, among many other criteria. I think it's interesting to see how many professions agree and disagree of working from home because it provides valuable insights into the varying dynamics of different industries and the diverse needs and preferences of workers. Understanding these perspectives can inform decisions regarding remote work policies, workplace flexibility, and the future of work arrangements.

For the pie chart, I wanted to take a closer look at a specific line of work. I chose engineers because they are the type of worker that seems most likely to like working from home but I was suprised to see that it was nearly equal in their like and dislike. This unexpected finding prompts further investigation into the factors influencing engineers' attitudes toward remote work. It raises questions about the perceived benefits and challenges of working from home within the engineering profession, as well as the impact of individual preferences, job roles, and organizational cultures. Exploring these nuances can provide valuable insights into the complexities of remote work adoption and effectiveness within specific occupational groups.

Note: this was just for curiosity's sake but apparently the acronym APSPDCL means Andhra Pradesh Southern Power Distribution Company Limited which is located in India.

Question 1 Answer: There seems to be no steady relationship between the profession and whether the person is satisifed or dissatisfied working from home. Every profession varied in what they do and every answer was either split down the middle or had almost no similarity. Therefore, there is no influence that can be pointed out with this data. However, it's fascinating to observe how individual preferences and circumstances shape one's satisfaction with remote work, regardless of their profession.
